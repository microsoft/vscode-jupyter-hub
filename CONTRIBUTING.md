npm ci
```

### Incremental Builds

* Run `npm run esbuild-node-watch` for desktop version of extension
* Run `npm run esbuild-web-watch` for desktop version of extension
* Run `npm run test-compile-watch` for compilation of tests for the desktop as well as some scripts required for Web Tests
* Run `npm run test-compile-wepack-watch` for compilation of tests for the web

### Errors and Warnings

TypeScript errors and warnings will be displayed in the `Problems` window of Visual Studio Code.
Best to use the command `npm run test-compile-watch` to get `Problems` showing up in the `Problems` window.

### Run dev build and validate your changes

To test changes, open the `vscode-jupyter` folder in VSCode, and select the workspace titled `vscode-jupyter`.
Then, open the debug panel by clicking the `Run and Debug` icon on the sidebar, select the `Extension`
option from the top menu, and click start. A new window will launch with the title
`[Extension Development Host]`.

### Running Desktop Tests

* Setup and start Jupyter Hub locally
    * Update the `./build/jupyterhub_config.py` to replace `runner` with the username of the current computer
    * Launch JupyterHub via the CLI `python -m jupyterhub --config <fully qualified path to Jupyter Hub repo>/build/jupyterhub_config.py`
    * Verify Jupyter Hub is running and listening at `http://localhost:8000`
* Run the script `npm run esbuild-node-watch`
* Run the script `npm run test-compile-watch`
* From within VS Code run the launch option `Tests`


### Running Web Tests

* Setup and start Jupyter Hub locally
    * Update the `./build/jupyterhub_config.py` to replace `runner` with the username of the current computer

    * Verify Jupyter Hub is running and listening at `http://localhost:8000`
* Run the script `npm run esbuild-web-watch`
* Run the script `npm run test-compile-watch`
